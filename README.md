### Project Summary
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

### Business Case
In this project, we will build a model to predict whether a given customer defaults or not. Credit default is one of the most important problems in the banking and risk analytics industry. There are various attributes which can be used to predict default, such as demographic data (age, income, employment status, etc.), (credit) behavioural data (past loans, payment, number of times a credit payment has been delayed by the customer etc.

### The Goal
In this project, we will build a model to predict whether a given customer defaults or not.

### Files Desription
credit-card-default: the file contains 30,000 observations of individuals who defaulted or did not default their credit card payment

### Installation
To be able to perform all the task stated above in the different phases, Python should be installed with the following libraries need; Python version used 3.7

* Scikit-learn
* Numpy
* Pandas

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@oriyomistephen/credit-card-default-prediction-8c9e0601c30e?sk=ecedc1336e1eff11a8721e270772d79d)
